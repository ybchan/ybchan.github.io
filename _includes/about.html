                I am a Research Associate at Harvard Medical School, where I studied the molecular and neuronal basis of innate behaviors. I performed RNA-seq analysis using R to identify the genes that modulate level of aggression <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/9/2373.long">(Chowdhury and Chan et al., 2017).</a>> More recently, I used linear regression and random forest algorithms to study correlation between behavioral data and neural function, and identify pairs of neuron that medicate aggressive behavior <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31231050/">(Alekseyenko and Chan et al., 2019).</a> During my research career, I mentored over 10 postdoctoral researchers and students, and worked collaboratively with colleagues in various projects that resulted in over 10 peer-reviewed publications.

                In addition to my research experience, I have extensive interest in the field of data science. I joined the competitive Insight Data Science Fellowship program, where I created a web app that used computer vision AI to identify candy and warn users for any potential food allergens. I also love to teach and mentor students. I have worked as teaching assistant at Harvard Extension School where I led the online discussion sections of data science classes. I covered topics on both supervised and unsupervised learning including regression, classification, clustering methods and other machine learning algorithms.
